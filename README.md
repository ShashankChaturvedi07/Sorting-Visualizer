# 📊 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A React-based interactive tool to **visualize how sorting algorithms work** step-by-step. This project animates sorting logic using vertical bars, color codes, and speed control — helping users understand algorithms deeply and intuitively.


## ✨ Features

✅ Supports multiple sorting algorithms:
- 🫧 Bubble Sort  (Compare ➝ Swap ➝ Reset)
- 📐 Selection Sort (Min selection ➝ Swap)  
- 🔢 Insertion Sort  (Insert ➝ Shift values)
- ⚡ Quick Sort  (Pivot partitioning)
- 🧬 Merge Sort  (Divide ➝ Merge phases)


✅ Real-time animations with color-coded steps:
-🔵 Blue	Default/Reset →  After each operation finishes 
-🟡 Yellow → Comparing When two bars are being checked 
-🔴 Red  →  Swapping When two bars are actually swapped 
-🟢 Green → Sorted/Final position When all sorting is done
 


✅ Additional controls:
- User input (comma-separated integers)
- Random array generation
- Animation speed control
- Sorting method selection
- Reset button

🚀Concept-
Two bars are compared → turn yellow.
If one is greater than the other → turn red and get swapped.
After the swap → both turn blue again (resting).
At the end of sorting → all bars turn green to show completion.
